# pcd-bridge

## Introduction

This repository contains software configured to interface ROS 1 point cloud data publishers with ROS 2 point cloud data subscribers. The code in this repository is intended to replace the use of [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge). `ros1_bridge` is useful for generally interfacing ROS 1 and ROS 2 software, but is associated with issues when used within Docker. This software uses the MQTT protocol to transfer data between ROS 1 and ROS 2 applications.
